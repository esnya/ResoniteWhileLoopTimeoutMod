# AGENTS (Repository Root)

This file is **authoritative and persistent** for everything under `/WhileLoopTimeout`. Keep it in version control and treat its directives as mandatory.

## Directives

1. **Golden rule:** Relentlessly minimize complexity, maximize changeability, and enforce strict static checks to suppress runtime bugs. Names, code, and directory structures must be self-explanatory—avoid relying on comments/docs for basic comprehension.
2. **Testing cadence:** Hands-on runtime testing happens later in a live Resonite session; until then, document assumptions and leave TODOs rather than speculative fixes.
3. **Localization:** UI remains English-only until Resonite exposes extensible localization hooks. Do not ship partial translations; revisit only when upstream enables custom locale registration.
4. **Knowledge management:** Split knowledge based on disclosure level.
   - Public/committable notes (design decisions, checklists) belong in versioned docs like this AGENTS file or other repo docs.
   - Private, potentially sensitive research (e.g., raw assembly dumps, exploratory notes) must live under the git-ignored `local_notes/` directory, each topic in its own markdown file to keep knowledge granular.
5. **Persistence:** Any change to policies/workflow must be reflected here immediately. Subdirectories inherit these rules unless they define their own `AGENTS.md`.
6. **Data model constraints:** This mod must not introduce new FrooxEngine data-model types or `SyncDelegate` definitions. All functionality must be built on existing data-model constructs to avoid sync registration overhead.
7. **Design notes ban:** Do not create standalone design notes or ADR-style docs; instead, keep commits and code self-explanatory and update this AGENTS file if process rules change.
8. **Task completion ritual:** Before declaring any task done, run the following commands in order and address all failures:
   - `dotnet format WhileLoopTimeout.sln --verify-no-changes --no-restore`
   - `dotnet build WhileLoopTimeout.sln --no-restore`
   - `dotnet test WhileLoopTimeout.sln --no-restore`
   Capture key failures in the report/PR and rerun after fixes.
9. **WSL / cross-platform NuGet hint:** If `dotnet build`/`test` fails with `Unable to find fallback package folder 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\NuGetPackages'`, do one of the following before rerunning the commands:
   - Export an override to point at a real folder, e.g. `DOTNET_MSBUILD_SDK_RESOLVER_CLI_FALLBACK_FOLDER=$HOME/.nuget/fallback dotnet build ...` (create the folder first).
   - Add a symlink/mount so that the Windows path exists from Linux (`sudo mkdir -p /mnt/c/Program\ Files\ \\(x86\\)/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio/Shared/NuGetPackages`).
   - Remove the Windows-only fallback entry from the active `NuGet.Config`.
   Tasks stay “in progress” until at least one of these mitigations succeeds.

## Scope / Status

- Repository initialized 2025-11-15 with WhileLoopTimeout for ResoniteModLoader.
- Current deliverable: Guard ProtoFlux `While`/`AsyncWhile` loops with abortable timeouts to keep sessions responsive.

## Localization Policy (Public Summary)

- English-only interface. Reevaluate once Resonite core supports custom localized strings for Dev Tool menus and UIX builders.

## History Tracking Rule

- Detailed work history lives in the git commit log; do not maintain manual work logs in docs. Summaries belong in commit messages and PR descriptions only.
